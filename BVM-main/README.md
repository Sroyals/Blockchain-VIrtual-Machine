# Blockchain Virtual Machine (BVM)

A Python-based virtual machine for executing smart contract bytecode, supporting contracts in 6 programming languages.

## Features
- Compiles Python/ C/ Java/ CPP/ JS/ C# Contracts to custom bytecode
- EVM-inspired architecture with gas accounting
- Supports:
  - Arithmetic/logic operations
  - Conditional statements (`if/else`)
  - Loops (`while`, `for`)
  - Persistent storage

## Quick Run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AakashHarsh/BVM
cd BVM/bvm_project
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install pycparser
pip install javalang
pip install esprima
python3 main.py contracts/math1.py contract2 500000
```

## Detailed Steps
### Prerequisites
- OS: Linux
- Python 3.8+
- `pycparser` (for C contracts):  
  ```bash
  pip install pycparser
- `javalang` (for Java contracts):  
  ```bash
  pip install javalang
- `esprima` (for JavaScript contracts):  
  ```bash
  pip install esprima

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AakashHarsh/BVM
cd BVM/bvm_project
```

### Run the BVM
```bash
python3 main.py <contract_path> <address> <gas_limit>
```
Command Arguments

| Argument        | Required | Description                          | Example           |
|----------------|----------|--------------------------------------|-------------------|
| `contract_path` | Yes      | Path to contract file with extension | `contracts/math.c` |
| `address`       | Yes      | Unique contract identifier           | `contract1`        |
| `gas_limit`     | Yes      | Maximum gas for execution (integer)  | `500000`           |

### Example usage
```bash
python3 main.py contracts/math1.py contract2 500000
```
Similarly C, Java, CPP and JS contracts can be executed just by replacing contracts/math1.py with the path to corresponding C or java or CPP or JS file respectively.

## Execution Output Example

```text
Starting BVM with contract 'contract2'...
